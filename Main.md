This tab contains the quick settings for ZScreen:
  * Destinations (select separately for each type of content: Image, text, file and URL)
    * Note that these destinations have to be first set up with proper account information (username and password).
    * If you select a server that is not set up yet, ZScreen will not warn you; but it will not upload your content, either.
  * Image settings
    * Delay before the screen is captured (defined in ms, s, min, Hr). The delay is useful if the capturing is interfering with the actual operation of your target application. Thus you can first set up a delay, and then go on using the target application. Zscreen will snap the screenshot automatically at the preset time.
    * Prompt for file name: This is useful when there is no fixed pattern in what you capture; and each individual image requires a different file name. If all your images are related, consider saving the file names with a pattern (provided in the **Options** tab, **Naming Conventions** sub-tab).
    * Show cursor in screenshots: Sometimes you want to capture the mouse-pointer in the image (especially when the pointer has a distinct shape, and you want to mention that in your text).
