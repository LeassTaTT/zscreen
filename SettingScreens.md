ZScreen is very flexible. Practically all operations can be configured.

The ZScreen settings are divided in tabs. <br />
These tabs are arranged logically, in the order of operations. <br />
Some of the tabs have sub-tabs.

The tabs are:
  * [Main](Main.md): Quick general-purpose settings
  * [Hotkeys](Hotkeys.md): Change the keyboard shortcuts to your liking
  * [Capture](Capture.md): Settings related to all different screen-capture modes
  * [Actions](Actions.md): Actions that can be taken on the captured image (e.g. edit)
  * [Destinations](Destinations.md): Set the destinations for uploading.
  * [History](History.md): If there is an error in an upload, trace it and correct the mistake.
  * [Translator](Translator.md): User Google Translator to translate the contents of your clipboard.
  * [Options](Options.md): General program options (unrelated with screen-capture or uploading)
  * [Advanced options](AdvancedOptions.md): Detailed options
