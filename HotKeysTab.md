# Introduction #

This section describes the **Hotkeys** tab of Zscreen.


# Details #

Note: A "Hotkey" is a specific combination of keys on your keyboard. If you press these keys together, Zscreen will launch the corresponding action.

The screen has three columns:
|**Description** | The functions that can be triggered using a hotkey.|
|:---------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
|**Hotkey** |The hotkey that is currently defined. These are actually buttons that you can press to change the hotkey for a given function. After pressing a button, you must immediately press the new hotkey. ZScreen will assign this new hotkey to the function, and display it here. If the hotkey is already in use, Zscreen will warn you. You can either go ahead with the assignment, or abort the attempt.|
|**Default hotkey**|This column contains the default value for all hotkeys. If you want to restore the default value to any function, just double-click on that default value. ZScreen re-assigns the default value to that function.|
