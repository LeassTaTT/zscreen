Icons in tabs
Screenshots tab should support double clicking screenshots from ImageShack
Support for "sets" via right-click menu which allows creation of a new directory in your previously specified path automatically using two controls "Start Set" and "End Set." Optionally run image editing software for each individual image. Optionally have the directory pop up in explorer after you have ended the set. Optionally upload entire set and create new directory. Optionally set clipboard to that URL. All optional settings will save themselves for next time you wish to create a set.
Support for dual monitors
Support for scrolling windows via new hotkey
Rounded window corners
Multiple region selection via control in Crop

yeah, but with big images, there's (a) no way to choose to auto resize it to the view size (b) the images don't stick to the edges of the preview pane (you can literally and completely move them out of view to the point where you lose the image altogether and can't click on it [you have to reclick the imagename to restore it to its default position]

so the ability to 'view remote directory' to preview screenshots and to be able to rename something from there would be convenient
