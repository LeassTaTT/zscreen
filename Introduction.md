ZScreen is a powerful and flexible Screen capture-cum-upload software.


It has various capture modes:
  * Crop shot (any random region of the screen)
  * Selected window part
  * Active window (when multiple windows are open on the screen)
  * Freehand crop shot (draw any freehand shape to capture specific parts of screen)
  * Webpage (scroll down the page and capture the entire page)

After capturing, you can optionally edit the image.
  * Built-in annotator (to place boxes or other symbols)
  * Built-in effects (shadows,
  * Process the captured image in any external editor (GIMP, InkScape, etc.)

Upload the raw or edited image to any host service of your choice.

Optionally, ZScreen can also OCR (optical character recognition) your image, and place the resultant text on clipboard. Now you can paste the text anywhere.
