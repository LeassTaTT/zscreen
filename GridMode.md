The fundamental concept behind Grid Mode is the unit block. By default the size of a unit block is 100 by 100 pixels. With this unit block, you could capture predefined sizes such as

| 100x100 | 200x100 | 300x100 |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| 100x200 | 200x200 | 300x200 |
| 100x300 | 200x300 | 300x300 |

In order to successfully generate a predefine portion,

  1. Press the Crop Shot hotkey
  1. Press the PMB once, drag to create the desired area
  1. Keep holding the PMB and use the Up|Down|Left|Right keys to position the rectangle to satisfaction
  1. Release the PMB
