# Setting up ZScreen for the first time #
Before you can use ZScreen, you must set it up.
Launch Zsreen. Its window shows the settings.

  * At minimum, you should set up your target destinations(websites where you want to send your captured images, text, files and URLs).
  * Select whether you want to capture your mouse with the screenshots.
  * Set the delay (after you press the hotkey, ZScreen will wait for a preset time and then capture.)
  * Optionally, change the settings of the Zscreen's look during the capturing (e.g. cursor, cross-hair, borders, etc.)
  * Optionally, you can activate Zscreen's Quick Action Toolbar. This toolbar stays floating on the screen, and you can click on any button to use Zscreen in any mode.

See the Settings section for more details.

# First use #

ZScreen can be used in the following modes:
  * Use a hotkey to use the Zscreen in specific capture mode (full screen, freehand, free region, etc.)
  * Click on a button on ZScreen's Quick Action toolbar.
